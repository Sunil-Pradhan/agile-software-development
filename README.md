# Agile Software Development

🧠 **Agile** is a way of managing projects — especially software development. It’s all about:

- Working in **small chunks**
- Getting **feedback early and often**
- Being **flexible** to change
- Delivering **value quickly**

Instead of planning everything upfront for years (like building a house from blueprints), Agile teams build things step by step and improve along the way.

## 🌀 What is Scrum?

Scrum is the **most popular Agile framework** — it breaks work into short cycles called **Sprints** (usually 2-4 weeks) to deliver working software frequently.

### 📌 Purpose of Scrum

Scrum helps teams:

- Break down big projects into smaller, manageable parts
- Get feedback fast
- Work in a focused and organized way

### 🧱 Scrum Pillars

- **Transparency** – Everyone knows what’s going on.
- **Inspection** – Team reviews work regularly.
- **Adaptation** – Team adjusts based on what’s working and what’s not.

### 👥 Scrum Roles

There are three primary roles in Scrum:

**🧑‍💼 Product Owner**

- Owns the product vision.
- Prioritizes what features to build.
- Works closely with customers or stakeholder.

**📦 Example:** For an e-commerce site, the Product Owner might decide the team should build “One-Click Checkout” before “Dark Mode.”


**👨‍🏫 Scrum Master**

- Ensures the team follows Scrum practices.
- Removes obstacles and supports the team.

**🚧 Example:** If developers are blocked due to unclear requirements, the Scrum Master helps resolve it.

**🧑‍💻 Development Team**

- Builds the product.
- Works together to complete tasks during the sprint.

**👨‍💻 Example:** Developers, testers, and designers building the “Wishlist” feature in 2 weeks.
