# Agile Software Development

🧠 **Agile** is a way of managing projects — especially software development. It’s all about:

- Working in **small chunks**
- Getting **feedback early and often**
- Being **flexible** to change
- Delivering **value quickly**

Instead of planning everything upfront for years (like building a house from blueprints), Agile teams build things step by step and improve along the way.

## 🌀 What is Scrum?

Scrum is the **most popular Agile framework** — it breaks work into short cycles called **Sprints** (usually 2-4 weeks) to deliver working software frequently.

### 📌 Purpose of Scrum

Scrum helps teams:

- Break down big projects into smaller, manageable parts
- Get feedback fast
- Work in a focused and organized way

### 🧱 Scrum Pillars

- **Transparency** – Everyone knows what’s going on.
- **Inspection** – Team reviews work regularly.
- **Adaptation** – Team adjusts based on what’s working and what’s not.

### 👥 Scrum Roles

There are three primary roles in Scrum:

**🧑‍💼 Product Owner**

- Owns the product vision.
- Prioritizes what features to build.
- Works closely with customers or stakeholder.

**📦 Example:** For an e-commerce site, the Product Owner might decide the team should build “One-Click Checkout” before “Dark Mode.”

**👨‍🏫 Scrum Master**

- Ensures the team follows Scrum practices.
- Removes obstacles and supports the team.

**🚧 Example:** If developers are blocked due to unclear requirements, the Scrum Master helps resolve it.

**🧑‍💻 Development Team**

- Builds the product.
- Works together to complete tasks during the sprint.

**👨‍💻 Example:** Developers, testers, and designers building the “Wishlist” feature in 2 weeks.

### 📅 Scrum Events (Ceremonies)

Scrum defines specific time-boxed events to create regularity and minimize unnecessary meetings.

**1. Sprint Planning** – Plan what to work on during the next sprint.

- 🕒 Time: 1-2 hours (for a 2-week sprint)
- 🎯 Goal: Choose tasks from the **Product Backlog**.

**2. Daily Scrum (Stand-up)** – 15-minute daily meeting.

- 🔁 Share what you did, what you’ll do, and if you're blocked.

**3. Sprint Review** – Demo the work completed in the sprint.

- 📽️ Show stakeholders what was built.
- 💬 Get feedback.

**4. Sprint Retrospective** – Reflect on how the team worked.

- ✅ What went well?
- 🛠️ What can be improved?

**🛒 Example:** For an online store, a team might plan to build the “Product Filter” feature in Sprint Planning, discuss progress in daily standups, demo it to stakeholders during the Review, and improve teamwork in the Retrospective.

### 📋 Scrum Artifacts

Artifacts represent the work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

**📦 Product Backlog**

- List of everything to build.
- Maintained and prioritized by the Product Owner.

**🧾 Example:** “Add to Wishlist”, “One-Click Checkout”, “Search by Category”.

**📝 Sprint Backlog**

- Tasks selected for the current sprint.
- Managed by the development team.

**✅ Example:** “Design Wishlist UI”, “Develop backend API”, “Write tests”.

**🚀 Increment**

- The working product at the end of a sprint.
- Must be in a usable condition.

**🔍 Example:** A basic “Wishlist” that lets users save products.

**🧾 Definition of Done (DoD)**

- Checklist to say when work is truly “done”.

**✅ Example:** Code complete + Tested + Reviewed + Deployed

> **💻 E-Commerce Use Case:**
> An e-commerce team can use Jira to track user stories like “Implement Wishlist Feature” across Sprints, assign tasks, and monitor progress using burndown charts.
