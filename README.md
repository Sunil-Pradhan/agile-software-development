# Agile Software Development

ðŸ§  **Agile** is a way of managing projects â€” especially software development. Itâ€™s all about:

- Working in **small chunks**
- Getting **feedback early and often**
- Being **flexible** to change
- Delivering **value quickly**

Instead of planning everything upfront for years (like building a house from blueprints), Agile teams build things step by step and improve along the way.

## ðŸŒ€ What is Scrum?

Scrum is the **most popular Agile framework** â€” it breaks work into short cycles called **Sprints** (usually 2-4 weeks) to deliver working software frequently.

**ðŸ“Œ Purpose of Scrum**

Scrum helps teams:

- Break down big projects into smaller, manageable parts
- Get feedback fast
- Work in a focused and organized way

**ðŸ§± Scrum Pillars**

- **Transparency** â€“ Everyone knows whatâ€™s going on.
- **Inspection** â€“ Team reviews work regularly.
- **Adaptation** â€“ Team adjusts based on whatâ€™s working and whatâ€™s not.
