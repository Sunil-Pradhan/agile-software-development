# Agile Software Development

ðŸ§  **Agile** is a way of managing projects â€” especially software development. Itâ€™s all about:

- Working in **small chunks**
- Getting **feedback early and often**
- Being **flexible** to change
- Delivering **value quickly**

Instead of planning everything upfront for years (like building a house from blueprints), Agile teams build things step by step and improve along the way.

Agile can be implemented using different frameworks or methods, such as:

- Scrum
- Kanban
- XP (Extreme Programming)
- Lean
